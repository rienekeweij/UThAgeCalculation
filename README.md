# UThAgeCalculation

There are 2 projects in this repository.

1. Cave Model

To run this project just type

$ python3 UThAgeCalculation.py

This code will read the input data from the directory ./data/exampleCaveModel

2. Sample Age Calculation

This project is to calculate 230Th/234U ages (NOT 230Th/238U!), for example I am using this to recalculate published ages for which only 230Th/234U ratios were reported.

The code will read user-defined 230Th/234U and 234U/238U ratios (see R230_234 and R234_238).
